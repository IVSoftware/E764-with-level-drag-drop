This answer uses a custom `GridViewEx` class inherited from `GridView` which allows the objective of **Reordering grouped rows using drag & drop** to be achieved in a clean manner without a lot of code mixed in with the main form. Your post and additional comments state two requirements and I have added a third goal to make the look and feel similar to the drag drop functionality that already exists for the records.

- Before or After Target Row
- Expanded rows stay expanded
- Drag feedback similar to row version
